# Forgebot (Future Tooling)

This folder is reserved for future helper scripts that:

- scaffold new games from the template
- batch-renumber CaveCode Blocks
- auto-generate HTML shells from CaveCode

For now, it’s just a placeholder to signal the intent:

> The Forge will eventually get its own tools.
