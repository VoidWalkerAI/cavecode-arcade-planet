# CaveCode Validator

A small helper script that checks whether a CaveCode file:

- contains BLOCK definitions
- uses at least one of the standard glyphs:
  - 🪨, 🖍️, 🔧, 🎮, 🌐
- has some basic structural sanity (no totally empty sections)

> It is *not* a strict compiler.
> It’s a spellchecker for your stone tablets.
